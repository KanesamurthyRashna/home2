		<h1>The Characters:</h1>
		
		<h2>Marinette Dupain-Cheng</h2>
		<p>Marinette Dupain-Cheng is one of the two main protagonists in 
		the show. She is a student at Collège Françoise Dupont in Paris, France. Her 
		best friend is Alya C&eacute;saire. She is a blogger who wanted to know a lot 
		about Ladybug and update all the information on her blog. Marinette may seem 
		like an average high schooler, but she has a secret. She is Ladybug, one of the 
		saviours of Paris! Both Ladybug and Catnoir save Paris when there is an akumatized 
		villain. Besides her superhero life, she really loves fashion design and is willing 
		to create her own brand one day! She also loves making arts and crafts for her loved 
		ones. She really loves playing video games and is also one of the best players in 
		the show. Her favourite pets are hamsters. She really loves music, and her favourite 
		singers are Jagged Stone and Clara Nightingale.</p>
		
		<h2>Adrien Agreste</h2>
		<p>Adrien Agreste is the other main protagonist of the show. He is also another student 
		at Collège Françoise Dupont in Paris, France, and is also Marinette’s classmate. His best 
		friend is Nino Lahiffe. Adrien is a fashion model for his father’s brand. He only has a 
		father since his mother died near the beginning of his life. So, he lives with his father 
		in a huge mansion, who is really cruel to him and doesn’t let him do what he wants. However, 
		Adrien doesn’t let that stop him; he is Cat Noir, another saviour of Paris. Also, both Ladybug 
		and CatNoir's identities remain a secret from each other, so no one knows what their real 
		identities are except for the audience. One of his hobbies is playing the piano. He has also 
		created a whole song for Marinette, also known as his girlfriend, in season 5.</p>
		
		<h2>Gabriel Agreste</h2>
		<p>Gabriel Agreste is the father of Adrien Agreste. He is the main villain in the show and is really 
		cruel to Adrien. Gabriel is also known as Monarch who is Ladybug and CatNoir’s main rival. Monarch 
		is trying to get the ladybug and black cat miraculous to make a wish. Monarch has done so many cruel 
		things to Ladybug and CatNoir just to get the miraculouses and make a wish. The wish that he wants to 
		make is to get his wife alive again. </p>
		
		<h2>Lila Rossi</h2>
		<p>Lila Rossi is one of the main villains in the show. She is also another classmate of Marinette 
		and hates Marinette so much. Lila really loves attention, and to get the attention that she needs she lies to everyone.  
		The reason why she hates Marinette is because she can never get away with her lies since she always figures out the truth. 
		She also sometimes works with Gabriel Agreste to get Adrien but soon realized that would not happen because Adrien starts 
		dating Marinette. </p>
