		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<h2>About the show:</h2>
		
		<p>Miraculous Ladybug is a cartoon about two teenage superheroes.  
		As one of the world’s highest-grossing television series, Miraculous 
		Ladybug is a show that has caught a lot of attention from both children 
		and teens alike.  Miraculous Ladybug was originally going to be an 
		anime but was changed last minute into an animated cartoon with a high 
		CGI budget in hopes of getting more viewers attention internationally. 
		As the show has currently progressed into its fifth season, the plot has 
		developed towards a more mature audience.  As a result, Miraculous Ladybug 
		has become a cartoon rated 13+ by season 5.  </p>
		
		<h3>The Origin</h3>
		<p>The show started off with a teenager named Marinette Dupain-Cheng. She is 
		an average high school girl,  with loving parents who own their own bakery 
		(the best one in town).  It’s now the first day of school, and she is running 
		late to school (like always), but on her way there she saw an old “blind” man 
		crossing the road when he was not supposed to. Marinette ran to rescue him before 
		getting in an accident with the car. As soon as she helped him, he slipped a piece
		of jewelry into her purse without her knowing. 
		<br> 
		<br>
		Then, the show takes to the second protagonist also known as Adrien Agreste. He is 
		also a teenager who is also known as the famous model in town for his dad’s brand. 
		He has been home-schooled for practically his whole life. His mother died near the 
		beginning of his life so he only has his father, but he is really strict. His father 
		doesn’t allow him to do many things on his own and doesn’t have that many friends 
		since he was homeschooled. So on the first day of school, he tried to leave home to 
		actually go to school in person but got caught by his dad later on. His father has an 
		assistant who convinced his father that Adrien should go to school and experience the 
		outside world. So his father let him go to school on the second day. However, when he 
		was about to go to school he noticed an old man losing his balance and falling onto the 
		ground. Adrien goes and helps the man up, and he secretly slips a piece of jewelry into
		his bag as well.
		<br>
		<br>
		These jewels are not any ordinary jewels, they are miraculous that would grant you a 
		special power. Marinette got the miraculous of the ladybug, which grants the power of 
		creation. Meanwhile, Adrien got the miraculous of the black cat, which grants the power 
		of destruction. They use these powers to fight akumatized villains for the greater good. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Fast Forward to Season 5</h3>
		<p>Marinette is now the guardian of the miraculous, and Gabriel Agreste also known as 
		Monarch has all the miraculouses except for the ladybug, black cat, peacock, and rabbit. 
		At the end of season 4 Felix stole all the miraculouses from Ladybug during the fight and 
		made a trade with Gabriel. He gave Gabriel all the miraculouses in return for the peacock 
		miraculous. In this season Gabriel has gotten so close to obtaining the miraculouses each 
		time but Ladybug and CatNoir always got away one way or another.</p>
		
		<h3>Spoiler</h3>
		<p>There has been a spoiler that Gabriel Agreste will get the ladybug and the black cat 
		miraculous. And that he would make the wish. The following audio shows us that he wishes 
		that Emily is alive, and he sacrifices himself for it. </p>
