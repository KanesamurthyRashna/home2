		<h1>The Lore</h1>
		
		<p>The main lore of Miraculous Ladybug is Gabriel’s. Gabriel Agreste 
		and his wife Emily Agreste had a cute son named Adrien Agreste. However, 
		on a trip, they found the miraculous of the butterfly and the miraculous 
		of the peacock. They didn’t know that the miraculous of the peacock was 
		broken and Emily used the miraculous. She soon grew ill and went into a 
		coma. She hasn’t come back to life in the past 14 years and right now 
		Gabriel is trying to get the miraculous of creation (ladybug) and the 
		miraculous of destruction (black cat).
		<br>
		<br>
		It turns out that Felix was a senti-monster this whole time. Felix is not a
		real human, but in fact a senti-monster that has been created by his father. 
		Since his father used the peacock miraculous, he also eventually passed away
		because he grew sick. The reason why Felix was created was because the parents
		of Felix soon realized that they can not have a child, so his father created one.
		Since his father fell ill, his father always saw him as a monster because his 
		father believes the fact that the only reason why he grew ill was because he 
		used the peacock miraculous to create Felix.

		<br>
		Afterwards, Gabriel Agreste finds a way to fix the peacock miraculous again so 
		it does not affect the next miraculous holders. Since the miraculous is now fixed no
		one can get sick and go into a coma forever. 
		<br>
		<br>
		As soon as Felix realized that he was a senti-monster he tried his best to obtain the
		rings from Gabriel since that's where the amoke was. He did not want Gabriel to hold hostage
		of him like how he holds hostage of Adrien. Therefore, he goes and steals the rings. Well it's
		not called stealing if it's his, right? However, he soon realized that he also needs
		the peacock miraculous to have control of his whole life. If he did not have the peacock miraculous
		Gabriel is still capable of taking over his life. Which is way Felix makes the trade near the end of
		season 4. The trade consists of him handing over practically all the miraculouses, and in return he 
		gets the peacock miraculous.
